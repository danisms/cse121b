            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Interactive Tic Tac Toe is a single-player computer game.<br>
                The computer is built to challenge players in competitive games,
                aiming to improve concentration and logical reasoning skills.
            </p>
            <h3>How To Play</h3>
            <p>
                The player selects a difficulty level from the available options (Easy, Medium, Hard).
                Each level of difficulty represents the level of reasoning that the machine employs while interacting with the player.
                Hard, requiring a high level of concentration and reasoning to win.<br><br>
                In the first round, the player makes the starting move, followed by the computer. If the game ends without a winner, the first move is alternated, with the computer making the first move and vice versa.
                However, if there is a winner, the winner takes the first move in the second round.<br><br>
                Every time the player wins, the computer delivers a joke as a form of reward.
                Interestingly, for every loss by the player, the computer provides an inspirational quote as a form of motivation.
            </p>
            <h3>Note</h3>
            <p>
                To end the game, click the pause button at the top of the screen, located between the player and computer score trackers.<br><br>
                In addition to the ending the game with the pause button, the game prompts players to either end or continue playing after each win or loss.
            </p>
